  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

@article{Li_Liu_Zong_Zhao_Zhang_Song_2020, title={Graph Attention Based Proposal 3D ConvNets for Action Detection}, volume={34}, url={https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/5893}, DOI={10.1609/aaai.v34i04.5893}, abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;The recent advances in 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) have shown promising performance for untrimmed video action detection, employing the popular detection framework that heavily relies on the temporal action proposal generations as the input of the action detector and localization regressor. In practice the proposals usually contain strong intra and inter relations among them, mainly stemming from the temporal and spatial variations in the video actions. However, most of existing 3D CNNs ignore the relations and thus suffer from the redundant proposals degenerating the detection performance and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose graph attention based proposal 3D ConvNets (AGCN-P-3DCNNs) for video action detection. Specifically, our proposed graph attention is composed of intra attention based GCN and inter attention based GCN. We use intra attention to learn the intra long-range dependencies inside each action proposal and update node matrix of Intra Attention based GCN, and use inter attention to learn the inter dependencies between different action proposals as adjacency matrix of Inter Attention based GCN. Afterwards, we fuse intra and inter attention to model intra long-range dependencies and inter dependencies simultaneously. Another contribution is that we propose a simple and effective framewise classifier, which enhances the feature presentation capabilities of backbone model. Experiments on two proposal 3D ConvNets based models (P-C3D and P-ResNet) and two popular action detection benchmarks (THUMOS 2014, ActivityNet v1.3) demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance achieved by our method. Particularly, P-C3D embedded with our module achieves average mAP 3.7% improvement on THUMOS 2014 dataset compared to original model.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={04}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Li, Jin and Liu, Xianglong and Zong, Zhuofan and Zhao, Wanru and Zhang, Mingyuan and Song, Jingkuan}, year={2020}, month={Apr.}, pages={4626-4633} }
