DGL is an easy-to-use, high performance and scalable Python package for deep learning on graphs. DGL is framework agnostic, meaning if a deep graph model is a component of an end-to-end application, the rest of the logics can be implemented in any major frameworks, such as PyTorch, Apache MXNet or TensorFlow.

GNNLens2 is an interactive visualization tool for graph neural networks (GNN). It allows seamless integration with [deep graph library (DGL)](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl) and can meet your various visualization requirements for presentation, analysis and model explanation. It is an open source version of [GNNLens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11048) with simplification and extension.
