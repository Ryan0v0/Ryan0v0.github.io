Flower (`flwr`) is a framework for building federated learning systems. The
design of Flower is based on a few guiding principles:

* **Customizable**: Federated learning systems vary wildly from one use case to
  another. Flower allows for a wide range of different configurations depending
  on the needs of each individual use case.

* **Extendable**: Flower originated from a research project at the University of
  Oxford, so it was built with AI research in mind. Many components can be
  extended and overridden to build new state-of-the-art systems.

* **Framework-agnostic**: Different machine learning frameworks have different
  strengths. Flower can be used with any machine learning framework, for
  example, [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org),
  [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org), [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/), [PyTorch Lightning](https://pytorchlightning.ai/), [MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/), [TFLite](https://tensorflow.org/lite/), [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/
) for federated analytics, or even raw [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
  for users who enjoy computing gradients by hand.

* **Understandable**: Flower is written with maintainability in mind. The
  community is encouraged to both read and contribute to the codebase.
