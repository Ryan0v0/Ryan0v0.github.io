Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge, supervised by [Nic Lane](http://niclane.org/) at the Cambridge Machine Learning Systems Lab ([CaMLSys](https://mlsys.cst.cam.ac.uk/)). I'm also a member of Cambridge AI Safety Lab, working on AI Alignment and Interpretability. Iâ€™m currently visiting the Vector Institute, working with [Colin Raffel](https://colinraffel.com/) at the University of Toronto. I interned at Microsoft Research, mentored by [Alessandro Sordoni](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/alessandro-sordoni) and [Lucas Caccia](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~lpagec/).

My research focuses on:

* Modular, distributed/decentralised training (model merging, Mixture-of-Experts) and decentralised inference;
* Data attribution/selection/curation/balancing/mixing, synthetic data generation and curriculum design for foundation model training;
* Compositional reasoning of large language models (in math and coding domains)

Prior to Cambridge, I was glad to be advised by [Yongxin Tong](https://yongxintong.github.io/) and [Xianglong Liu](https://xlliu-beihang.github.io/). I also spent wonderful time doing research at AWS AI Lab mentored by [Minjie Wang](https://jermainewang.github.io/) and [Zheng Zhang](https://research.shanghai.nyu.edu/centers-and-institutes/datascience/people/zheng-zhang), where I worked on [Deep Graph Library](https://www.dgl.ai/) ![Github stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dmlc/dgl) and its interpretability toolkits [GNNLens2](https://github.com/dmlc/GNNLens2)![Github stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dmlc/GNNLens2).
