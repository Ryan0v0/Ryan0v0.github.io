Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge, supervised by Prof. [Nic Lane](http://niclane.org/) at the Cambridge Machine Learning Systems Lab ([CaMLSys](https://mlsys.cst.cam.ac.uk/)). I'm also a member of Cambridge AI Safety Lab, working on AI Alignment and Interpretability. Iâ€™m currently visiting the Vector Institute, working with Prof. [Colin Raffel](https://colinraffel.com/) at the University of Toronto.

My research targets the development of more decentralized AI by focusing on AI methods that are less centralized and more collaborative. 

Prior to Cambridge, I was glad to be advised by Prof. [Yongxin Tong](https://yongxintong.github.io/) and Prof. [Xianglong Liu](https://xlliu-beihang.github.io/). I also spent wonderful time doing research at AWS AI Lab mentored by Dr. [Minjie Wang](https://jermainewang.github.io/) and Prof. [Zheng Zhang](https://research.shanghai.nyu.edu/centers-and-institutes/datascience/people/zheng-zhang), where I worked on [Deep Graph Library](https://www.dgl.ai/) ![Github stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dmlc/dgl) and its interpretability toolkits [GNNLens2](https://github.com/dmlc/GNNLens2)![Github stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dmlc/GNNLens2). 

<span style="background-color: #F9EAFB">I'm open to collaborations in all forms and would love to explore any opportunities!</span> Feel free to contact me by Email (wz341 [AT] cam.ac.uk or zhaowrenee [AT] gmail.com), [Wechat](https://github.com/Ryan0v0/Ryan0v0.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/wechat.jpg), or [Calendly](https://calendly.com/wanru-zhao).
