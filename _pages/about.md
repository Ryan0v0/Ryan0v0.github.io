Hey, thanks for stopping by!ðŸ‘‹

I'm an M.Phil student at the University of Cambridge. I'm studying Advanced Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science and Technology. My research interests lie on Machine Learning Systems, Human-AI Interaction and Graph Neural Networks. I'm currently working on Federated Learning at the Cambridge Machine Learning Systems Lab (CaMLSys), supervised by Prof. Nic Lane. 


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
