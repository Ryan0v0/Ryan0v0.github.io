Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an M.Phil student at the University of Cambridge. I'm studying Advanced Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science and Technology. My research interests lie on Machine Learning Systems, Human-AI Interaction and Graph Neural Networks. I'm currently working on Federated Learning at the Cambridge Machine Learning Systems Lab (CaMLSys), supervised by Prof. [Nic Lane](http://niclane.org/). I'm also a member of Cambridge AI Safety Lab, working on AI Alignment and Interpretability. 

Prior to Cambridge, I was glad to be advised by Prof. [Yongxin Tong](https://yongxintong.github.io/) and Prof. [Xianglong Liu](https://xlliu-beihang.github.io/). I also spent wonderful time doing research at AWS AI Lab mentored by Dr. [Minjie Wang](https://jermainewang.github.io/) and Prof. [Zheng Zhang](https://research.shanghai.nyu.edu/centers-and-institutes/datascience/people/zheng-zhang).

I'm always happy to have all forms of collaboration! Feel free to contact me by Email (wz341 [AT] cam.ac.uk or zhaowrenee [AT] gmail.com) or [Wechat](https://github.com/Ryan0v0/Ryan0v0.github.io/blob/1ac9b7c3b2c8c0d55b2a3516fc1d8f03489f889e/assets/img/wechat.jpg).
