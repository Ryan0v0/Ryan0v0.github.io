Hey, thanks for stopping by!ðŸ‘‹

I'm an M.Phil student at the University of Cambridge. I'm studying Advanced Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science and Technology. My research interests lie on Machine Learning Systems, Human-AI Interaction and Graph Neural Networks. I'm currently working on Federated Learning at the Cambridge Machine Learning Systems Lab (CaMLSys), supervised by Prof. Nic Lane.
