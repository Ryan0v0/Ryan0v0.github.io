👩‍💻 My Chinese name is 赵婉如 (趙婉如 in traditional Chinese). The pronunciation of my given name roughly sounds like "One Rule" in English, while it actually derives from a line in the Chinese Classic of Poetry (詩經): "有美一人，婉如清揚", which means "there is a lady, graceful and poised".

🧗🏻‍♀️ I am an avid outdoor enthusiast. I was a member of my university's mountaineering team and climbed the impressive Peak Nochma of Minya Konka (5588m). 

📚 I love reading and photography. The works of [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) and [Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus) have profoundly influenced me. I also find solace and introspection in poetry, and view coding as a form of writing 'poetry'. 

🎬 At Cambridge, I'm an active member of [Diffraction Theatre](https://www.diffractiontheatre.com/programme), where I contribute my expertise in artificial intelligence to foster interdisciplinary dialogues and create knowledge through theatrical practice. The COVID-19 pandemic and the impending era of flourishing AI have heightened my awareness of the moral responsibilities that accompany technological innovation as a computer science student. It has challenged me to consider the broader implications of my work and reinforced my dedication to ensuring that technology serves as a force for good, guided by conscientious and ethical decision-making.

I'm grateful that Cambridge has provided me with the freedom to explore this topic from personal and historical perspectives, as well as the opportunity to raise public awareness and encourage reflection on the ethical implications of AI. Our exhibition [Reimagine Copenhagen 1941](https://pq.cz/pq-2023-info/projects-2023/pq-studio/pq-studio-stage/reimagine-copenhagen-1941-diffraction-theatre/) at the [Prague Quadrennial 2023](https://pq.cz/) was a resounding success. This experience has been invaluable, as it not only enriches my personal growth but also informs my academic and professional pursuits, providing fresh perspectives and insights that transcend conventional disciplinary boundaries.
