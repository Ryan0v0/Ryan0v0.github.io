My Chinese name is 赵婉如 (趙婉如 in traditional Chinese). The pronunciation of my given name roughly sounds like "One Rule" in English, while it actually derives from a line in the Chinese Classic of Poetry (詩經): "有美一人，婉如清揚", which means "there is a beautiful woman, graceful and poised".

I am an avid outdoor enthusiast. I was a member of my university's mountaineering team and climbed the impressive Peak Nochma of Minya Konka (5588m). 

I love reading and photography. The works of [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) and [Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus)'s have profoundly influenced me, and I find solace and introspection in poetry. I also view coding as a form of writing poetry. 

At Cambridge, I'm in the team of [Diffraction Theatre](www.diffractiontheatre.com), where I contribute my expertise in AI and interactive design to foster interdisciplinary conversations and create knowledge through theatrical practice. Since COVID-19 pandemic and the upcoming era of flourishing AI, I have been contemplating AI ethics and considering how computer scientists like myself can positively contribute to society. I am fortunate that Cambridge has given me the freedom to explore this topic from a personal and historical perspective, as well as the chance to raise public awareness and encourage reflection on the ethical implications of AI.
