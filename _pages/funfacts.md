My Chinese name is 赵婉如 (趙婉如 in traditional Chinese). The pronunciation of my given name roughly sounds like "One Rule" in English, while it actually derives from a line in the Chinese Classic of Poetry (詩經): "有美一人，婉如清揚", which means "there is a lady, graceful and poised".

I am an avid outdoor enthusiast. I was a member of my university's mountaineering team and climbed the impressive Peak Nochma of Minya Konka (5588m). 

I love reading and photography. The works of [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) and [Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus)'s have profoundly influenced me, and I find solace and introspection in poetry. I also view coding as a form of writing poetry. 

At Cambridge, I'm a member of [Diffraction Theatre](www.diffractiontheatre.com/programme), where I contribute my expertise in AI and interactive design to foster interdisciplinary conversations and create knowledge through theatrical practice. Since COVID-19 pandemic and the upcoming era of flourishing AI, I have been contemplating AI ethics and considering how computer scientists like myself can positively contribute to society. I am fortunate that Cambridge has given me the freedom to explore this topic from a personal and historical perspective, as well as the chance to raise public awareness and encourage reflection on the ethical implications of AI. 

Reimagine

Our project [Reimagine Copenhagen 1941](https://pq.cz/pq-2023-info/projects-2023/pq-studio/pq-studio-stage/reimagine-copenhagen-1941-diffraction-theatre/) has been selected to exhibit at the Prague Quadrennial 2023. 

This reflective process is invaluable, as it not only enriches my personal growth but also informs my academic and professional pursuits, providing fresh perspectives and insights that transcend conventional disciplinary boundaries. 

As a computer science student, I am acutely aware of the moral responsibilities that accompany technological innovation. 

The portrayal of Oppenheimer’s journey, marked by groundbreaking discoveries alongside profound ethical conflicts, echoed my conviction that technological advancements should be guided by a steadfast commitment to ethical principles.
This reflection was not merely an academic exercise but a personal reckoning with the values I uphold in my field. The film underscored the importance of maintaining moral integrity in the face of the potentially far-reaching and unforeseen consequences of technological progress. It challenged me to consider the broader implications of my work and reinforced my dedication to ensuring that technology serves as a force for good, guided by conscientious and ethical decision-making. Movies make me reflect on my future and the connection between my profession and ethics. This insight is something I can only gain through the art of cinema, which is why I deeply value it. 

I aim to deepen my understanding of the cinematic arts, explore the myriad ways in which technology and storytelling converge, and participate in dialogues that bridge cultural and disciplinary divides.
